## Overview

This is the third project in the responsive web developer path for devchallenges.io

The demo solution I did can be found at https://oinsur.github.io/interior-consultant-page/

I was able to get the layout to work by creating another html page for the menu at the mobile size. I was pleased with my result.
I learned how to use material icons in my layouts. I thought that this was very helpful. I had used icons previously but just as svg files.
I had also created hamburger icons in html with css; using material icons is much more efficient.
I would like to hear any feedback about that. I am sure there is a solution that involves JavaScript but I am still learning to work with HTML & CSS.
